“MAY THE BUILDING of a strong mind and a strong body be the greatest work I have ever made,” reads the set of Dior’s latest runway to present the spring/summer 2025 collection. It’s a quote from SAGG Napoli, born Sofia Gianni, a multidisciplinary artist tapped by Dior to create the scenography for the Dior spring/summer 2025 runway — a whirling group of similar phrases scribed upon a 70-metre metal and glass structure.

For the collection, creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri honed in on the notion of feminine strength with a collection inspired by athleticism and Amazons.

“Pushing back the boundaries between the oeuvre itself and the artistic process, the Creative Director aims to bring fashion back to its origins and emphasise the relationship connecting the body and what dresses it, between intention and function,” the show notes read. To that end, Chiuri began her process of archival reinterpretations with Christian Dior’s iconic Amazone dress for autumn/winter 1951-1952, which led her down a familiar path of female empowerment — forever a steady compass for the designer.
