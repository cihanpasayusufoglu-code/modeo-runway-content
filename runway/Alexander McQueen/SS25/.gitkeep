McGirr’s inspiration is, of course, a direct reference to Alexander McQueen’s AW94 collection Banshee, which saw models ascend the runway in plaster cast bustiers, and a pregnant skinhead with “MCQUEEN” stencilled onto her head. Debuted in west London’s now defunct Café de Paris nightclub, McQueen’s second runway show was inspired by the banshees of Irish folklore, supernatural beings who wail and scream to warn of impending death. “For me, [the banshee] has come to represent something real and potent now,” said McGirr in today’s notes. “The idea of someone who is feeling and forthright; someone who can be seen as a guiding force.”
